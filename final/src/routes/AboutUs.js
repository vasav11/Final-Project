        <p>
        The Shiksa-Sage was founded in the early 1950s by visionary educators Vasav Chaudhary
        and Professor Emily Roberts. Their mission was to create an inclusive and innovative learning 
        environment for students of all backgrounds. With a small team of dedicated educators, they 
        established the institute in a modest building in the heart of a bustling city.
